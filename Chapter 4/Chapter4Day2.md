## What does .link() do?

### The .link() function is a function that assigns references of resources to either the /public/ path or /private/ path of the account storage. The .link() function does not store data in the /public/ path or /private/ path, but instead gives the /public/ path or /private/ path the capability to see references to data that is "linked" such as resources in the /storage/ path.

## 2. In your own words (no code), explain how we can use resource interfaces to only expose certain things to the /public/ path.

## 3. Deploy a contract that contains a resource that implements a resource interface. Then, do the following:

## 3i. In a transaction, save the resource to storage and link it to the public with the restrictive interface.

## 3ii. Run a script that tries to access a non-exposed field in the resource interface, and see the error pop up.

## 3iii. Run the script and access something you CAN read from. Return it from the script.
