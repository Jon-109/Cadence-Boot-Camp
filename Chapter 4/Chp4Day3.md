# Chapter 4 Day 3 Quest Answers

## 1. Why did we add a Collection to this contract? List the two main reasons.

### When NFT's are created they need a unique storage path and it is much easier to organize all the resources in a collection created by the contract at one storage path rather than individual storage paths for each NFT. Moreover since only the account owner has access to the storage path, the owner cannot receive NFT's from other people. A collection fixes this.

## 2. What do you have to do if you have resources "nested" inside of another resource? ("Nested resources")

### If you have resources (perhaps NFT's) "nested" inside of another resource (perhaps a collection) in Cadence, you must declare a destroy function that manually destroys those "nested" resources (perhaps NFTs) with the destroy keyword.

## 3. Brainstorm some extra things we may want to add to this contract. Think about what might be problematic with this contract and how we could fix it.

Idea #1: Do we really want everyone to be able to mint an NFT? ðŸ¤”.

Idea #2: If we want to read information about our NFTs inside our Collection, right now we have to take it out of the Collection to do so. Is this good?
